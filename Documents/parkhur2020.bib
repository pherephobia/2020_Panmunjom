Did these policy changes constitute critical junctures, or something less, and if so why? The theory consists of three elements-economic crisis, ideational change, and the nature of the policy change-that must be identified for us to be able to declare with some certainty if a policy change constitutes a critical juncture. Herein, we will be examining the roles of a variety of change agents including the media, central banks, and politicians. Our findings will help explain why Irish industrial policy was transformed in the late 1950s, while Swedish macroeconomic policy underwent only minor change in the early 1980s. {\textcopyright} 2012 Policy Studies Organization.},

abstract = {The causal logic behind many arguments in historical institutionalism emphasizes the enduring impact of choices made during critical junctures in history. These choices close off alternative options and lead to the establishment of institutions that generate self-reinforcing path-dependent processes. Despite the theoretical and practical importance of critical junctures, however, analyses of path dependence often devote little attention to them. The article reconstructs the concept of critical junctures, delimits its range of application, and provides methodological guidance for its use in historical institutional analyses. Contingency is the key characteristic of critical junctures, and counterfactual reasoning and narrative methods are necessary to analyze contingent factors and their impact. Finally, the authors address specific issues relevant to both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons of critical junctures.},

abstract = {Divided government provides ambiguous and conflicting information about which branch of government to hold accountable for government performance. The implication for presidents, who are easy targets of blame, is that they are less likely to be held accountable for government's failures during periods of divided government because the public has a plausible alternative for affixing responsibility: the U.S. Congress. Because presidents are punished more heavily for negative outcomes than they are rewarded for favorable ones, we argue that a divided government context has the effect of increasing presidential approval relative to periods of unified government. At the individual level, using data from the 1972-1994 National Election Studies we show that divided government increases the probability that respondents approve of a president's job performance. This effect is even stronger among citizens who are knowledgeable about control of government. Examining approval at the aggregate level from 1949 to 1996, we find further evidence that divided government boosts presidential approval ratings.},

How does the American public respond to foreign news when its government and the news media promote competing frames and change their prominence according to the relations between the U.S. and that foreign country The present study shows this frame building and frame effects by using a public opinion poll and content analysis of U.S. policy statements and media coverage. North Korea was chosen because its visibility to the American public has increased since President George W. Bush designated it as one of the countries in the "axis of evil". The results show that during a four-month period, the U.S. government and the newspaper produced three competing frames, and that the magnitude of the frames shifted as U.S.North Korean relationships shifted. These shifts in turn made the American public choose economic sanctions over military solutions toward the country.},

abstract = {The American policy landscape during the George W. Bush administration was shaped by a series of traumatic events that confronted the nation and people of the United States. These included the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in 2001, the anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001, military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the threat of a flu pandemic in 2005 and 2006, the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, and the financial collapse of 2008. The results of the 2008 presidential election appear to be a rejection of the Bush administration's major policy responses to these events, but the variation in type and level of public support among different groups suggests a much more varied and dynamic portrait of America in turbulent times. Using a multiyear panel survey, an interdisciplinary team of political scientists and psychologists analyzed the behavior and political responses to the events by the American public. The findings suggest that even seven years after the events of 11 September 2001, people with higher levels of post-traumatic stress symptomatology related to 9/11 have significantly different interpretations of the threat of terrorism and the appropriate policy responses to it than do others. Perceptions of threat, the political salience of terrorism and other traumatic events, the level of support for political leaders and assessments of the government's actions vary over time and across different groups within society based on the psychological, political and social, and personal characteristics of the respondent. These results help to open the black box of aggregate public opinion by providing a detailed portrait of how psychological, social, political, and personal factors affected perceptions and political behavior during the George W. Bush administration. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Does information irrelevant to government performance affect voting behavior? If so, how does this help us understand the mechanisms underlying voters' retrospective assessments of candidates' performance in office? To precisely test for the effects of irrelevant information, we explore the electoral impact of local college football games just before an election, irrelevant events that government has nothing to do with and for which no government response would be expected. We find that a win in the 10 d before Election Day causes the incumbent to receive an additional 1.61 percentage points of the vote in Senate, gubernatorial, and presidential elections, with the effect being larger for teams with stronger fan support. In addition to conducting placebo tests based on postelection games, we demonstrate these effects by using the betting market's estimate of a team's probability of winning the game before it occurs to isolate the surprise component of game outcomes. We corroborate these aggregate-level results with a survey that we conducted during the 2009 NCAA men's college basketball tournament, where we find that surprising wins and losses affect presidential approval. An experiment embedded within the survey also indicates that personal well-being may influence voting decisions on a subconscious level. We find that making people more aware of the reasons for their current state of mind reduces the effect that irrelevant events have on their opinions. These findings underscore the subtle power of irrelevant events in shaping important real-world decisions and suggest ways in which decision making can be improved.},

abstract = {Efficient stock markets react to news. News about future economic policies can be derived from political events such as elections, the formation of new governments, changes in the composition of governments, etc. However, the news content of these events depends on the electoral system. In the American electoral system, characterized as it is by majority representation and single-party governments, elections generate news to the extent that the results are unexpected. In countries with proportional representation, governments are frequently multi-party coalitions whose composition is difficult to predict from the election results. These results therefore contain much less information about future policies, Our results, obtained for the Brussels stock market, support this distinction. Furthermore, the ideological composition of the government also matters; these effects support a rational partisan approach.},

abstract = {Partisanship and issue orientations are among the foundational concepts for behavioral researchers. We seek to understand their causal relationship. One view suggests that party identification, as a central and long-standing affective orientation, influences citizens' issue positions. Another view claims that issue orientations influence party identification. We take both theories into account in this article and argue that the direction of causality may depend upon the political context. Using the Political Socialization Panel Study, we analyze the long-term dynamic relationship between partisanship and issue orientations. The results from our cross-lagged structural equation models are inconsistent with a single, time-invariant, unidirectional causal story. The causal relationship between partisanship and issue orientations appears to depend upon the larger political context. In the early period from 1973 to 1982, partisanship causes issue orientations. In the later period, from 1982 to 1997, the causal arrow is reversed, and issue orientations significantly shape partisanship. {\textcopyright} 2011 Southern Political Science Association.},

@article{Hiller1998,
abstract = {Mega-events are usually assessed in terms of the economic impact of the event itself with little attention given to the event as part of a broader process that can be investigated longitudinally. An adapted political economy model is proposed (because the mega-event is seen as essentially an economic initiative) that distinguishes three kinds of linkages. Forward linkages refer to the effects caused by the event itself. Backward linkages refer to the powerful background objectives which justify or rationalise the event. Parallel linkages are side-effects which are residual to the event itself and not directly under the control of event organisers. This longitudinal approach also distinguishes between pre-event, event and post-event impacts so that unintended and unanticipated consequences can be identified. The model is applied to the issue of displacement as a parallel linkage and to other issues of housing and impacts on neighboring communities to the mega-event site. It is concluded that impact assessment ought to be part of every mega-event plan, and that impact equity and a mitigation plan to control adverse affects ought to be in place.},

abstract = {Although scholars debate the influence of election campaigns on electoral decision making, they agree that campaigns do have effects. Empirically identifying the effects of the campaign is not straightforward, however. We simply do not have regular readings of voter preferences over the election cycle, and the readings we do have are imperfect. Clearly then, an important question is, Can we actually detect the effects of election campaigns? In this article, the authors consider the practice of identifying campaign effects, focusing particularly on survey error and its consequences for empirical analysis. Using selected poll data from the 2000 presidential election cycle, they illustrate how the various forms of survey error complicate the study of campaign effects. The authors also offer certain solutions, although these only take us part of the way. Indeed, given the available data, it appears that all that can be offered are fairly general conclusions about the effects of election campaigns.},

abstract = {No factor appears more powerful in explaining how individuals evaluate political information and form political preferences than partisanship. Yet, virtually all work on the effects of partisanship on preference formation neglects the crucial role of social settings. In this study, I examine how social settings can fundamentally change the influence of partisanship on preferences. I demonstrate that, in fact, social settings exert an independent influence over preference formation-one that is even larger than the influence of partisan ambivalence. The central implication of these findings is that, going forward, we cannot fully explore how citizens apply their partisanship in evaluating political information without also accounting for the social settings in which individuals find themselves. {\textcopyright} 2014, Midwest Political Science Association.},

abstract = {I assess the extent of "partisan voting" in American national elections since 1952 using a series of simple probit analyses. My measure of partisan voting is sensitive both to changes in the distribution of partisanship and to changes in the electoral relevance of partisanship. I find that the imparct of partisan loyalties on voting behavior has increased in each of the last six presidential elections, reaching a new level in 1996 almost 80 percent higher than in 1972 - and significantly higher than in any presidential election in at least 50 years. The impact of partisanship on voting behavior in congressional elections has also increased markedly, albeit more recently tand to a level still well below that of the 1950s. I conclude that the conventional wisdom among scholars and commentators regarding the "decline of parties" in America is badly outdated.},

abstract = {Cleavage structure cuts across the members of a state and affects the electorate's choice of parties and candidates. Social cleavage structure can be stable or go through changes depending on on-going social change as well as political parties' electoral strategies. With the collapse of communism and the advent of the third wave of democracy, many countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia have experienced rapid social change. New political parties have formed, and democratic elections have been introduced in most of these countries. With rapid social change and the resulting shifts in party strategies, do we also expect rapid change in social cleavage structure in these countries? Or does cleavage structure change only gradually and remain stable over a short-term period? In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions by examining the relative importance of three cleavages commonly claimed to have relevance to politics in the 2000s-regionalism, ideology, and generational differences-in voters' choices in Korea. We analyze the voting behavior of the electorate in the 16th and 17th National Assembly elections, in 2000 and 2004, respectively, by employing multinomial logistic analyses of voter survey data. Our analysis indicates that the relative importance of various cleavages changed during the early 2000s: the influence of regionalism remained strong, but its intensity declined; the importance of ideology grew; and a new cleavage of generational differences appeared. Our study shows that the cleavage structure is fluid even in a short-term period, especially in new democracies, as citizens and elites adjust their behaviors in response to changing social situations. Political parties may also introduce a particular electoral strategy to induce change in the cleavage structure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper is an empirical analysis on the roles of political ideology and political knowledge in the formation of policy preferences. It is well known that political idelogy functions as an anchor in the formation of policy preferences, and that political knowledge plays an intervening role between political ideology and policy preferences. Previous studies hold that the effects of political ideology on policy preferences depend upon the levels of political knowledge. More precisely, the effects of political ideology in the formation of policy preferences are consistent and stable across policy issues among those who hold high level of political knowldge. My analysis supports this finding. Political ideology plays a statistically significant role in the formation of policy preferences among those who have high level of political knowledge but not among those who shows low or medium levels of political knowledge. Based on this finding, I argue that political knowledge is a critical variable in understanding and explaining the formation of policy preferences and electoral choice. I also argue that it should be catious in estimating the roles of political ideology in the formation of policy preferences.},
